# Online Modelling of Signalling Parameters

This repository provides a website running a [JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/) instance 
for interactive modelling of signalling parameters as described in the paper
*"Characterisation of genetically encoded hydrogen peroxide sensor dynamics"* 
by Lind, Rohwer, Veal and Pillay.

To access the site, go to https://signalparameters.github.io, and one the environment has loaded,
open the `Analyse_signalling.ipynb` notebook by double-clicking on the file name in the left tab.

To enable full use of the functionality, it is best to run the site in a Chromium-based browser
(e.g. Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, Vivaldi, etc.). Some of the widgets do not work in Firefox.
